# Tic-Tac-Toe

A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game written using TypeScript. The game has basic logic to try preventing the player from winning - you can use the developer console to see when the computer moves logically or randomly.

## Improve the logic

Think you can make the logic stronger and the game tougher? Feel free to submit a pull request containing your updated TypeScript file and complied JavaScript file.
