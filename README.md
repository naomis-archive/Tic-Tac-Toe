A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game written using TypeScript. The game has basic logic to try preventing the player from winning - you can use the developer console to see when the computer moves logically or randomly.

## Live Version

This page is currently deployed. [View the live website.](https://www.nhcarrigan.com/Tic-Tac-Toe)
